# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis:

The school board found evidence of academic dishonesty in the students_complete.csv file. The reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders seemed to have been altered. The board is unsure of the impact these scores have on the overall restuls, but what to uphold state-testing standards. Therefore, I was asked to remove the 9th grade reading and math scores for Thomas High School and repeat the district analysis.

- Student count changed from 39,170 to 38,709
- Total budget remained the same as the scores are not connected to the budget.
- Average Math Score remained the same, which means the hundreds of data points removed did not have a big enough impact to be represented in the overall average of the roughly 39,000 students
- Average Reading Score remained the same, which means the hundreds of data points removed did not have a big enough impact to be represented in the overall average of the roughly 39,000 students
- % Passing Math: The percentage of passing students for math dropped by .1%
- % Passing Reading: The percentage of passing students for reading dropped by .1%
- % Overall Passing: The overall passing percentage dropped by 1%


## Summary

As demonstrated through the analysis of the metrics, the 9th graders being removed did not make a big impact on the district results. In order to see these changes I used the results prior to formatting the tables to give the percentages with 1 decimal value. Below, you will see the tables of the original data and then the new data once I removed the 9th grade scores.

Overall, the academic dishonesty of the 9th grade scores did not play a significant role in the overall results of the district. Once the formatting occurs and the results are rounded to the tenths place, the results are the same. Regardless, the new District Analysis has the corrections made so that the state report aligns to standard testing requirements.
